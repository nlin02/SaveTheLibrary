# Saving Professor P
2D side scrolling adventure game available at: https://nlin02.github.io/SaveTheLibrary/

By Bea Bautista, Linda Lor, Nina Lin, and Katie McCarthy

Your professor has gone missing–can you travel back in time, find him, and make sure he is safe?

Saving Professor P takes you through multiple levels, up against a time crunch, to the end goal of saving your professor. Use the arrow keys and the space bar to walk, jump, and climb through each level, avoiding the scorpions, spikes, and water.

We used Phaser, a 2D game framework, to make this game run on the desktop. We all used Visual Studio Code in conjunction with Github to make sure our version control with Git could run as smoothly as possible.


# Important Things To Know

You can use the above link to play the game browser. 
In your terminal be sure to run 'npm install'. If you want to run it locally, once the repository is downloaded and you are in the game’s terminal, type 'npm run start' in the terminal and copy and paste the local host into your browser of choice.

If you wish to update the link to reflect newly pushed code, use 'npm deploy'.

# Credits and Thanks
We would like to give a large shout out to SuperTommy for his extensive open source code that helped us navigate phaser. Specifically, we used “Making Your First Phaser Game in TypeScript.”

We’d also like to thank our professor, Paul Cantrell, for his advice, guidance, and support, and the rest of our COMP 225 class for class feedback.
